# UIUCLibrary Homebrew Tap for Beta Releases

This is the beta tap for tools released from University of Illinois library 
for the Homebrew package manager on Mac OS.

## This is for beta releases only
Releases distributed on the uiuclibrary/beta tap are BETA VERSIONS and might contain more than the average 
number of bugs typically found in an official release. 

It must be stressed that support for these releases can be extremely limited. 

## Instructions
To add uiuclibrary/beta to homebrew use the following command.
```shell script
brew tap uiuclibrary/beta
```
